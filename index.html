    <h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>
    <p>
      My name is Phohanh Tran. I am a front-end developer, with strong interests
      in data analysis and product management.
    </p>
    <p>I love to learn, and I love doing many things.</p>

    <br />
    <p>Here's a random Youtube video that I thought was interesting.</p>

      By far, one of the things I love the most is
      <i>talking with other people</i>. I love working in teams, because that's
      where I can bounce ideas off others most-easily, and hear the amazing
      ideas of my peers as well!
    </p>

    <br />
    <p>What are some things I love to learn about?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Database management systems</li>
      <p>I love SQL, and managing data!</p>
      <li>Business (Accounting and Finanace)</li>
      <p>
        I've been collecting personal financial data for the past
        <b>4+ years</b> now. This has really sparked an interest in accoutning
        and finance. I love managing money, and handling numbers!
      </p>
      <li>Full-Stack development</li>
      <p>
        My very first web-development experience was in the Spring of 2024 in my
        CSS 360 class with Ethan Uoung. This class then inspired me to make a
        small website for my friend's birthday, and led me to learn even more
        about the web in previous projects, my past internship, and now CSS 481
        (Web Programming)!
