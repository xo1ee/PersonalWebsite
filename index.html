        My name is Phohanh Tran. I am a front-end developer, with strong
        interests in data analysis and product management.
      </p>
      <p>I love to learn, and I love doing many things.</p>

      <br />
      <p>Here's a random Youtube video that I thought was interesting.</p>

      <br />
      <p>
        By far, one of the things I love the most is
        <i>talking with other people</i>. I love working in teams, because
        that's where I can bounce ideas off others most-easily, and hear the
        amazing ideas of my peers as well!

              I've been collecting personal financial data for the past
              <b>4+ years</b> now. This has really sparked an interest in
              accoutning and finance. I love managing money, and handling
              numbers!

              My very first web-development experience was in the Spring of 2024
              in my CSS 360 class with Ethan Uoung. This class then inspired me
              to make a small website for my friend's birthday, and led me to
              learn even more about the web in previous projects, my past
              internship, and now CSS 481 (Web Programming)!
